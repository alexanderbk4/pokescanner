# Development Guidelines Pre-Prompt

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **Environment**: Always use Python virtual environments for backend development

## Code Quality Standards
- Write modular, maintainable code optimized for future changes
- Follow best practices for each technology in the stack
- Include appropriate error handling
- Add docstrings and comments for complex logic
- Ensure code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

## Version Control Workflow
- Commit frequently after each significant change
- Use descriptive commit messages explaining what changed and why
- Create feature branches for major new features or changes
- Follow the format: `[type]: [description]` for commit messages (e.g., "feat: add user authentication")

## Debugging Approach
When encountering broken code that previously worked:
1. Identify the exact line causing the issue
2. Explain what went wrong
3. Provide at least 2 alternative solutions
4. Implement the recommended fix

## Virtual Environment Requirements
- Always set up and use a virtual environment for Python projects
- Include clear instructions for environment setup in the README
- Generate requirements.txt files when dependencies change

## Workflow Preferences
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable steps
- Provide status updates after implementing major components
- Suggest alternatives when encountering architecture decisions
- Test code frequently during development
